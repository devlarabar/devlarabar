### :smiley_cat: About Me
Hello! My name is Lara, and I'm a creative software engineer with a passion for health and wellness. I have a varied background, including experience in the military and transportation industry. I enjoy drawing, lifting heavy things, and gaming.

**Some fun facts about me:**
- :maple_leaf: I was born in the US, but grew up in Canada. I'm a very proud citizen of both countries.
- :video_game: Neopets was a huge part of my childhood. Ask me about [Grundo's Café](https://grundos.cafe)!
- :paintbrush: I am an artist and highly creative - coding is an extension of that creativity!
- :truck: I lived in a semi-truck for 3 years, where I learned to work, cook, code, and exercise in a tiny metal box on wheels every day.
