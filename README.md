### ðŸ˜„ About Me
Hello! My name is Lara, and I'm a creative developer with a passion for creating web applications that are responsive and mobile-friendly. For over three years, I lived full-time in a semi truck with my husband and cat, with little to no access to a computer or Wi-Fi. I relied heavily on my phone for everything from managing my business to gaming in my free time. It made me appreciate the importance of mobile-responsiveness in web apps.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy drawing, lifting heavy things, playing with my cat or gaming with my husband.
