### :smiley_cat: About Me
Hello! My name is Lara, and I'm a creative developer with a passion for health and wellness. I have a varied background, including experience in the military and transportation industry (ask me about my trucker wellness app!). When I'm not coding, I enjoy drawing, lifting heavy things, playing with my cat or gaming with my husband.

**Some fun facts about me:**
- :maple_leaf: I was born in the US, but grew up in Canada
- :video_game: My favourite video games are *Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*, *Fallout 4*, and *Minecraft*
- :paintbrush: I am an artist and highly creative - coding is an extension of that creativity!
- :truck: I lived full-time in a semi-truck for several years, where I learned to work, cook and exercise in a tiny metal box on wheels every day
