### ðŸ˜„ About Me
Hello! My name is Lara, and I'm a creative developer with a passion for creating web applications that are responsive and mobile-friendly. With the world transitioning to mobile, it is critical to ensure our content can be easily accessed and consumed on devices with small screens.

I have extensive experience with HTML and CSS, and am currently expanding my skillset to include programming languages beginning with JavaScript. In 2023, I will learn and create projects using tools including React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS, to be the best full-stack web developer I can be and make valuable contributions to the world of tech.
